# Evernode Auditor

## What's here?
*In development*

A node js version of evernode auditor

## Bootstrap Client
- Create a folder named datadir.
- Add the key file found on this [link](https://geveoau.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/EX5U8SxYyM5Anyq2rAcMXtkBEOO_XWT7hCo30SGIsDAyLg?e=LycwQx). This is because we have hardcoded the pubkey in message board. This will generate the same pubkey we have hardcoded. So we can safely communicate with bootstrap contract.

## Setting up auditor development environment
1. `npm install` (You only have to do this once)
1. Create auditor.cfg `{"xrpl":{"address":"","secret":"","hookAddress":""}, "instance":{"image":""}}`
1. Update xrpl account details.
1. `node auditor` (auditor.cfg need to be provided with xrpl account data)
1. To change rippled server run `RIPPLED_URL=<server url> node auditor.js`

## Installing auditor in prod environment
1. `cd installer && sudo ./auditor-install.sh` (You only have to do this once)
1. Update xrpl account details in `/etc/evernode-auditor/auditor.cfg`

## Generating setup package
1. `npm run build:installer` will create `dist/auditor-installer.tar.gz`

## Auditing
1. Default auditing contract and its client will be setup in installation if no customized contract is provided.
1. The audit contract client should have implemented an export audit function which wraps the audit process.
1. The audit function should return a boolean (true on audit sucess and false on audit failure).
```
exports.audit = async (ip, userPort) => {}
```
